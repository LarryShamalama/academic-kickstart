I am a first year PhD student in biostatistics at the [Dalla Lana School of Public Health](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. My research interests include causal inference, Bayesian methods and their application to observational data. I am also broadly interested in developing inference-based statistical models for matrix-valued or imaging data.

Following my remote first year of PhD studies, I am joining [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) as a Google Summer of Code student! You can follow my progress in my blog [here](https://larrydong.com/gsoc2021/).

Previously, I have pursued a joint Master's degree in Biostatistics at McGill University and in Public Health Data Science at the University of Bordeaux under an [IVADO scholarship](https://ivado.ca/en/spotlight-on-our-academic-community/?programmes=masters-excellence-scholarships). I was jointly supervised by [Dr. Erica Moodie](https://www.ericamoodie.com/) and [Dr. Rodolphe Thi√©baut](https://www.bordeaux-population-health.center/profile/rodolphe-thiebaut/).

I also enjoy [coding](https://github.com/larryshamalama) in Python, playing basketball and eating yogurt. Feel free to connect with me!
